# 2.13_Serverless_Assignment

Make a comparison between Serverless Framework and Terraform as tools for IaC by answering:

1. **What type of infrastructure and application deployments are each tool best suited for?**
    - Serverless Framework is best suited for Serverless application deployments, especially for cloud-native, event-driven architectures

    - Terraform is best suited for general infrastructure provisioning and management across a wide variety of cloud and on-premises environmentstext.

2. **How do their primary objectives differ?**
    - Serverless Framework focuses primarily on simplifying the development, deployment, and management of serverless applications and functions whereas Terraform focuses on general-purpose infrastructure provisioning and management across various cloud providers (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, etc.).

    - Target audience for Serveless Frameworks are developers building serverless applications with minimal infrastructure management compared to terraform which target at devOps teams and infrastructure engineers who need to manage complex infrastructure environments, including both traditional (VMs, networking) and modern (serverless, containers) resources. 

3. **How do they differ in terms of learning curve and ease of use for developers or DevOps teams?**
    - Severless Framework is considered easier for developers to get started with, especially those focused on serverless applications. The configuration is typically simpler, and the focus is mainly on serverles functions and their triggers. 
    - Terraform may has a steeper learning curve, especially for newcomers, because it is designed to manage a broad range of infrastructure, both cloud and on-premises.


4. **What are the differences in how each tool handles state tracking and deployment changes?**
    - Serverless manages the state of your serverless services behind the scenes, storing information about the resources it has deployed in AWS CloudFormation (for AWS) or similar mechanisms in other cloud providers.Changes to serverless functions are tracked within the configuration, and the Serverless Framework automatically handles deployment changes. However, state management is abstracted and not as visible to users as in Terraform.

    - Terraform uses an explicit state file to track the current state of the infrastructure. This state file is crucial for determining which resources need to be added, modified, or destroyed during a deployment. Terraform compares the desired state (as defined in .tf configuration files) to the current state (stored in the state file) and then calculates the necessary changes. It provides detailed feedback on what will be applied and prompts for confirmation before making changes.


5. **In what scenarios would you recommend using Serverless Framework over Terraform, and vice versa?**
    - Use Serveless Framework when 

        1. Application is event-driven and relies on cloud-native services like API Gateway, DynamoDB, S3, etc.
        2. You need rapid deployment and management of serverless resources without the need to manually manage the underlying infrastructure.
        3. Your focus is more on functionality and code rather than infrastructure setup and maintenance

    - Use Terraform if:

        1. Project requires detailed management of infrastructure state and precise control over resource dependencies, such as provisioning networks, storage, and compute resources.
        2. You need to manage complex, multi-cloud infrastructure that includes both serverless and traditional resources (e.g., VMs, networks, databases, Kubernetes).
        3. You want to implement best practices for infrastructure management such as versioning, state locking, and collaboration on infrastructure code

6. **Are there scenarios where using both together might be beneficial?**
    - Yes, there are cases where using both Serverless Framework and Terraform together can be beneficial

        1. When combining serverless and traditional infrastructure:
        If you have an application that includes both serverless functions (e.g., Lambda) and traditional infrastructure (e.g., EC2, VPCs, RDS), you can use Terraform to provision and manage the non-serverless infrastructure and use Serverless Framework for deploying serverless functions.
        
        2. Managing Dependencies in Complex Projects:
        If your application requires both serverless functions and more complex infrastructure setup (e.g., managing networking, IAM roles, databases, etc.), Terraform can handle the infrastructure part, while the Serverless Framework can simplify the deployment of Lambda functions and associated services.
